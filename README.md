## Reflection Questions

1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.
   StackOverflow.com

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words)
   One challenge that I encountered was that I was unsure how to add sound to the additional button I created. I wanted each of the buttons to represent one of the top teams in the English Premier league,
   but I struggled to get sound on the Manchester City button. To overcome this, I looked at how the sound was set up for the other buttons, retraced my steps, and realized by mistake came in the
   form of a syntax error. This helped me realize how intuitive this language was. This is my first time using html and javascript, but by tracing the steps backwards, I was able to learn a lot about the
   workings of these languages.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words)
   In many of my classes, and in this prework example, we are given starter code to help begin a project. Do most web developers also use starter code? If not,
   what does that process look like, and how does it work?

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words)
   If I had a few more hours to work on this project I would hide the images until the button is clicked, and add extra buttons and calibrate the frequencies so that
   it could play a recognizeable melody.
